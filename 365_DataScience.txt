MACHINE LEARNING
	The core of machine learning is creating an algorithm, which a computer then uses to find a model that fits the data as best as possible
	In machine learning, one does not give the machine instructions on how to find a model. Rather, one provides it with algorithms which give the machine directions on how to learn on its own
	A machine learning algorithm is like a trial-and-error process, but the special thing about it, is that each consecutive trial is at least as good as the previous one

Which line represents the four ingredients of any machine learning algorithm?
	correctData, model, objective function, optimization algorithm

In reinforcement learning, a reward system is being used to improve the machine learning model at hand. The idea of using this reward system is to:
	to minimize the objective function

Which of the following is true?
	“200,000 lines of data constitute big data.”
	“Every type of analysis can be considered BI.”
	“SWOT is a type of quantitative analysis.”


Indeed **365 Data Science program **is the best for beginners without any doubt. 
To start with the dimension of concepts covered in the Data science bundle which include 20+ courses has a wide range covering from the very basics of what the subject is all about, to mathematics, statistics and probability, to teaching the languages and tools that are an integral part of the data science study and implementation and last but not the least concepts of Machine Learning and Deep learning. Needless to mention that the course also includes hands on projects such as Credit Risk Modeling in Python, Customer Analytics in Python and more. 
Apart from the content, the quality of teaching is commendable, rarely found elsewhere. 
Also the team is reachable for any doubts.
